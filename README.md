# AccelRender

AccelRender is a mesmerizing project that transforms the real-time motion data from your Android device's accelerometer into captivating 3D visualizations in Blender. It's like giving life to your device's movements and watching them come alive in a virtual world.

## How It Works

1. **Mobile App:** We've created a special app for Android devices. This app uses the accelerometer, a magic sensor inside your phone, to feel how your device is moving. It's like a secret agent that senses every tilt and shake.

2. **Wi-Fi Connection:** The app shares this motion data over Wi-Fi with your computer and other devices. They all talk to each other like a team of superheroes working together.

3. **Blender Magic:** On your computer, we use a cool program called Blender. It takes the motion data from your app and turns it into a stunning 3D scene. It's like painting with motion!
